# RecipeRealm
RecipeRealm is a simple web application where users can share and explore cooking recipes online. It is built using Java (Servlets and JSP) for the backend and MySQL for the database. Users can register, log in, and add their own recipes with ingredients, steps, and images. They can also view other people’s recipes and leave comments to give feedback or suggestions.

There are two types of users: normal users and admins. Normal users can create and manage their own recipes, while admins have special access to review recipes, manage users, and remove any inappropriate content.

The main goal of RecipeRealm is to help people share food ideas and learn new recipes in an easy way. It also helps beginner developers understand how a full-stack Java web application works — from frontend to backend to database.

This project uses basic tools like HTML, CSS, JSP, Java Servlets, MySQL, and Bootstrap to make the interface user-friendly and mobile responsive.

RecipeRealm is useful for both food lovers and new programmers looking to build a meaningful and real-world Java project.
